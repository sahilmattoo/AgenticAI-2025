    "# Customer Support Goal-Oriented Multi Agent Flow (CrewAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "Customer support teams often receive diverse queries—from login issues and billing errors to technical problems. Manually analyzing each message, searching a knowledge base, generating a helpful response, and deciding whether to escalate takes time and is inconsistent across agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "This workflow uses a **goal-oriented multi-agent system** to automate support resolution. The flow dynamically analyzes the user's query using four cooperating AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Issue Identification Agent**  \n",
    "   Classifies the query by intent, urgency, and sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Search Agent**  \n",
    "   Searches relevant internal documentation or solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solution Generation Agent**  \n",
    "   Drafts a clear, user-friendly support response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Escalation Agent**  \n",
    "   Evaluates if the AI response is sufficient or requires human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "User input (`customer_query`) drives the reasoning across agents, making the workflow adaptable to real-world support scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Faster support  \n",
    "✔ Personalized responses  \n",
    "✔ Smart escalation logic\n"

      "\n",
      "7. **Disable Browser Extensions**: Advise the customer to disable any browser extensions that might interfere with the login process, particularly those related to security or privacy.\n",

      "8. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure that the customer has a stable internet connection, as connectivity issues can prevent successful logins.\n",

      "3. **Browser Issues**: Recommend clearing the browser cache and cookies, as outdated or corrupted data can cause login problems. Additionally, suggest trying a different browser or using incognito mode to rule out browser-specific issues.\n",

      "6. **Firewall/Antivirus Settings**: Advise the customer to check if their firewall or antivirus software is blocking access to the login page. They may need to temporarily disable these settings or add an exception for our site.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Network Issues**: Suggest checking their internet connection. A weak or unstable connection can prevent successful logins. If possible, they should try connecting to a different network.\n",

      "8. **Account Status**: Confirm that the customer’s account is in good standing and not suspended or deactivated. If there are any issues with their account status, they should reach out to support for clarification.\n",
