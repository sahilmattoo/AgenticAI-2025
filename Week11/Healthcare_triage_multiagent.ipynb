    "# Healthcare Triage Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Flow (CrewAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "In hospitals and emergency departments, medical staff must quickly assess patients and determine treatment priority. Manual triage can be inconsistent due to fatigue, workload, or limited medical information. A system is needed that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze symptoms\n",
    "* Assess severity\n",
    "* Assign care priority\n",
    "* Adapt decisions based on patient condition (stable vs. critical)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution uses a **goal-driven multi-agent workflow** where each AI agent has a specialized medical role. The system processes patient input and collaboratively decides urgency using structured reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow operates through the following agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symptom Extraction Agent**\n",
    "   Identifies key medical symptoms and clinical indicators from free-text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Severity Assessment Agent**\n",
    "   Evaluates symptom risk level and determines potential medical seriousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Strategy Agent**\n",
    "   Uses a hybrid approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Reactive Mode:** Immediate action for high-risk cases\n",
    "   * **Deliberate Mode:** Structured evaluation for non-critical cases\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Priority Assignment Agent**\n",
    "   Assigns a final triage level (Low, Medium, High, Emergency) with justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient input (`patient_details`) dynamically influences all reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Outcome**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Standardized medical triage\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Faster response to emergencies\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Human-overseeable decision logic\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Adaptable planning based on condition severity\n",

      "Final Answer: For managing mild fever, sore throat, and fatigue in patients with these symptoms, I recommend the following over-the-counter medications:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Acetaminophen (Tylenol)**: This medication is effective for reducing fever and alleviating mild to moderate pain, including sore throat discomfort. The typical dosage for adults is 500-1000 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 3000 mg in 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)**: Another option for fever and pain relief, ibuprofen can be taken at a dosage of 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, with a maximum of 1200 mg in 24 hours for over-the-counter use. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that may help with throat discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Throat Lozenges or Sprays**: Products containing benzocaine or menthol can provide temporary relief for sore throat symptoms. These can be used as directed on the packaging, typically every 2-4 hours as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Antihistamines (e.g., Diphenhydramine or Loratadine)**: If the sore throat is accompanied by post-nasal drip or allergy symptoms, an antihistamine may help alleviate these symptoms. Diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness, so it may be more suitable for nighttime use, while loratadine is non-drowsy and can be taken during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hydration and Rest**: While not medications, encouraging the patient to stay well-hydrated and get plenty of rest is crucial for recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to advise the patient to monitor their symptoms closely. If the fever persists for more than three days, or if they experience worsening symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, severe pain, or difficulty breathing, they should seek medical attention. Additionally, if they have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications, they should consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new medication.\u001b[0m\n",
