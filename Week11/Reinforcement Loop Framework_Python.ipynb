      "4. **Encourage Further Communication:**\n",
      "   - Invite the customer to ask questions or express any additional concerns. This shows that you value their input and are willing to assist further.\n",
      "   - Example: \"If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Follow-Up:**\n",
      "   - After resolving the issue, consider following up with the customer to ensure they received their order and are satisfied with the resolution. This can help rebuild trust and improve customer loyalty.\n",

For example, \"Hi [Customer's Name], I understand that your issue with [specific problem] is urgent, and I’m here to assist you right away.\"\n",
      "   - **Express Understanding:** Use empathetic language that validates the customer’s feelings. For instance, \"I can imagine how frustrating this must be for you, and I want to resolve it as quickly as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Streamlined Communication:**\n",
      "   - **Use of Templates:** Develop templates for common urgent inquiries that can be quickly customized. This allows for faster responses while maintaining a personal touch.\n",
