Round 2 introduced operational structuring, including role-based work hours, mandatory employee transition sequencing, and phased route integration. 9.7 Impact on Article 2 (V2). Work-hour compliance was restricted to Pilots and Cabin Crew, with Ground Staff excluded. Transition sequencing was fixed. 9.8 Impact on Article 7 (V2). Circuit-based route transition was introduced, creating conditionality for milestone completion. 9.9 Round 3 (Version 3). Round 3 focused on economic, liability, and governance refinement. 9.10 Impact on Article 2 (V3). Salary conversion logic for Pilots and Cabin Crew was introduced along with equity compensation restrictions. 9.11 Impact on Article 5 (V3). Vendor liability carve-outs and selective airport dues assumption were introduced. 9.12 Impact on Article 6 (V3). Board restructuring, voting control, tenure reduction, and conflict of interest enforcement were codified. 9.13 No Implied Waiver. Amendments shall not be construed as waivers of rights not expressly stated. 9.14 Future Amendments. Any future amendments must be in writing, reference affected clauses, and be approved in accordance with governance provisions. 9.15 Interpretive Guidance. This Article supports interpretive clarity but does not override operative provisions. 9.16 Survival. This Article shall survive termination of the Agreement.'}"

Route integration shall be executed in the following sequential phases:\\n(a) Circuit 1 – Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore; (b) Circuit 2 – routes operating more than\\none hundred (100) flights per day; and (c) Circuit 3 – all remaining routes.\\n7.3 Certification of Completion. Completion of each Circuit shall be certified in writing by the Joint\\nIntegration Committee upon confirmation of operational readiness, regulatory compliance, and service\\ncontinuity.\\n7.4 Employee Transition Milestones. Employee transitions shall occur in the mandatory order of Pilots,\\nCabin Crew, Technical Staff, and Ground Staff (to the extent applicable). Excluded personnel shall not\\nbe counted for milestone completion.\\n7.5 Payment Tranches. The total consideration shall be released in five (5) tranches as follows:\\nTranche 1 upon signing and initial regulatory acknowledgment; Tranche 2 upon Circuit 1 completion;\\nTranche 3 upon Circuit 2 completion; Tranche 4 upon completion of Pilot, Crew, and Technical Staff\\ntransition; and Tranche 5 upon final regulatory clearance and Circuit 3 completion.\\n7.6 Conditions Precedent. Payment of each tranche is subject to absence of material breach, accuracy\\nof representations, regulatory clearance, and compliance with confidentiality and governance\\nobligations.\\n7.7 Delays and Deferrals. Delays attributable to AirAsia shall result in deferral of the applicable tranche\\nwithout interest. Delays attributable to Vistara shall not trigger automatic acceleration but may require\\ngood-faith renegotiation.\\n7.8 Audit and Verification Rights. Vistara shall have the right to audit records and processes relevant to\\nmilestone completion. AirAsia shall provide reasonable access for verification purposes.\\n7.9 No Waiver or Acceleration. Failure to enforce a milestone shall not constitute waiver. No tranche\\nshall be accelerated except pursuant to written amendment.\\n7.10 Taxes and Withholding. All payments shall be subject to applicable tax withholding. Each Party\\nshall bear its own tax liabilities unless required otherwise by law.\\n7.11 Survival. Payment, audit, and verification obligations shall survive termination to the extent\\nnecessary to settle accrued amounts.',\n",

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue until completion of all\\nintegration activities and payment of all tranches, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this\\nArticle.\\n8.2 Termination for Material Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon material breach\\nby the other Party that remains uncured for thirty (30) days following written notice.\\n8.3 Exit by Vistara. Vistara may elect to exit the transaction prior to completion of milestones. Upon\\nsuch exit, all further employee transitions shall cease, no additional payment tranches shall be payable,\\nand unpaid tranches shall stand forfeited.\\n8.4 Consequences of Vistara Exit. Employees already transitioned shall remain employees of Vistara.\\nIntellectual property licenses shall terminate except for regulatory and operational continuity.\\nGovernance arrangements shall lapse prospectively.\\n8.5 Exit by AirAsia. AirAsia may exit only upon material breach by Vistara that remains uncured. Upon\\nsuch exit, unpaid tranches and board representation rights shall be forfeited.\\n8.6 Effect on Assets and Routes. Assets and routes already transferred shall not revert upon\\ntermination unless required by law.\\n8.7 Effect on Employees. Termination shall not retroactively affect salaries paid or service periods\\naccrued. No obligation to transition additional employees shall survive termination.\\n8.8 Effect on Payments. Payments made prior to termination shall be non-refundable except in cases of\\nfraud or willful misconduct.\\n8.9 Confidentiality and IP. Confidentiality and intellectual property obligations shall survive termination\\nin accordance with Articles 3 and 4.\\n8.10 Regulatory Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate with regulators to ensure orderly continuation\\nor unwinding of operations.\\n8.11 Remedies Cumulative.

       " 'ARTICLE 9 — AMENDMENTS, EVOLUTION & CHANGE': 'SUMMARY\\n9.1 Purpose. This Article documents the evolution of this Agreement across multiple drafting rounds\\nand serves as an authoritative reference for interpretation, audit, and automated analysis.\\n9.2 Amendment Methodology. Amendments were introduced incrementally to clarify scope, reallocate\\nrisk, and codify operational and governance decisions.\\n9.3 Round 1 (Version 1). Round 1 established baseline principles relating to asset transfer, employee\\npolicy alignment, confidentiality, and indicative governance intent.\\n9.4 Impact on Article 2. Initial obligations required all transitioning employees to follow Vistara policies\\nand work hours without role-based differentiation.\\n9.5 Impact on Article 3. Confidentiality obligations were defined at a high level without a public\\ncommunication hierarchy.\\n9.6 Round 2 (Version 2). Round 2 introduced operational structuring, including role-based work hours,\\nmandatory employee transition sequencing, and phased route integration.\\n9.7 Impact on Article 2 (V2). Work-hour compliance was restricted to Pilots and Cabin Crew, with\\nGround Staff excluded. Transition sequencing was fixed.\\n9.8 Impact on Article 7 (V2). Circuit-based route transition was introduced, creating conditionality for\\nmilestone completion.\\n9.9 Round 3 (Version 3). Round 3 focused on economic, liability, and governance refinement.\\n9.10 Impact on Article 2 (V3). Salary conversion logic for Pilots and Cabin Crew was introduced along\\nwith equity compensation restrictions.\\n9.11 Impact on Article 5 (V3). Vendor liability carve-outs and selective airport dues assumption were\\nintroduced.\\n9.12 Impact on Article 6 (V3). Board restructuring, voting control, tenure reduction, and conflict of\\ninterest enforcement were codified.\\n9.13 No Implied Waiver. Amendments shall not be construed as waivers of rights not expressly stated.\\n9.14 Future Amendments. Any future amendments must be in writing, reference affected clauses, and\\nbe approved in accordance with governance provisions.\\n9.15 Interpretive Guidance. This Article supports interpretive clarity but does not override operative\\nprovisions.\\n9.16 Survival. This Article shall survive termination of the Agreement.'}"

       "'=== ARTICLE 2 — OBLIGATIONS ===\\nArticle 2 outlines the obligations of both Parties during the Transition Period. Each Party is required to act in good faith and comply with relevant laws while fulfilling their ongoing responsibilities. AirAsia must facilitate the transfer of specified assets and operational controls to Vistara, which will only assume control after meeting regulatory requirements. The Article details the structured transition of employees, specifying eligibility criteria and compensation arrangements, as well as the need for compliance with Vistara\\'s policies. Additionally, it establishes audit rights for Vistara and outlines consequences for non-performance, including the potential suspension of integration activities or termination of the Agreement.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 3 — CONFIDENTIALITY, PUBLIC ===\\nArticle 3 outlines the obligations related to confidentiality, public communications, ethical conduct, and insider trading in the context of a merger and its subsequent operations. It defines \"Confidential Information\" and specifies exclusions, emphasizing that such information must only be used for the purposes of the agreement and not for personal gain. Access to this information is restricted on a need-to-know basis, and a structured framework for public communications is established, categorizing permissible, restricted, and prohibited actions. The article also addresses the handling of Material Non-Public Information (MNPI) and imposes insider trading restrictions during and after employment. Breaches of these obligations may lead to significant consequences, including termination and legal action, with confidentiality obligations surviving for five years post-termination.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 4 — INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ===\\nArticle 4 addresses the management of intellectual property (IP) related to the merger and subsequent operations. It establishes that each party retains ownership of their pre-existing IP while granting Vistara a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use AirAsia\\'s IP for specific operational purposes. Any IP created during the integration process will belong to Vistara, and AirAsia\\'s branding will have limited use post-merger. The article also outlines the handling of operational data and imposes restrictions on AirAsia regarding the use of Vistara\\'s IP. Additionally, it mandates that both parties notify each other of any suspected IP infringement, with Vistara holding the primary enforcement rights. The provisions of this article will remain in effect even after the agreement\\'s termination.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 5 — LIABILITY ===\\nArticle 5 outlines the allocation of liabilities and responsibilities between the Parties concerning pre-merger, transition, and post-merger activities. AirAsia retains responsibility for all liabilities incurred before the Effective Date, including employee claims and regulatory penalties. Vistara will not assume any liabilities related to vendors providing catering and food services, but will take on airport-related fees and charges associated with AirAsia operations. Employee claims will be managed based on the timing of their transition, with Vistara assuming responsibility for claims arising after the transition date. The Article also includes indemnification provisions for both Parties and establishes a claims process, with a limitation on liability for indirect damages, and specifies that these provisions will survive for seven years post-termination of the Agreement.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 6 — GOVERNANCE ===\\nArticle 6 outlines the governance structure for the merged operations, detailing the composition of the Board of Directors, decision-making authority, and oversight mechanisms. The Board will consist of ten directors, with seven appointed by the Parent Company and three by AirAsia, and the Chairperson will be nominated by the Parent Company, holding a casting vote in case of ties. Directors will serve a two-year term, with specific matters requiring the affirmative approval of Parent Company nominees. The Article also establishes the formation of Board Committees, mandates the disclosure of conflicts of interest, and emphasizes compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Breaches of this Article are considered material, allowing for remedies, and governance provisions will survive termination to ensure the enforcement of decisions made during the Agreement\\'s term.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 7 — MILESTONES & PAYMENTS ===\\nArticle 7 outlines the milestone-driven payment structure between Vistara and AirAsia related to the phased transfer of routes, assets, and employee integration. Payments are contingent upon the successful completion of specified integration phases, which are divided into three circuits, and are released in five tranches based on the achievement of defined milestones. The completion of each phase must be certified by the Joint Integration Committee, and employee transitions must follow a specified order. Delays caused by either party may affect the timing of payments, but do not automatically accelerate payment obligations. Additionally, Vistara retains the right to audit relevant records, and all payments are subject to applicable tax withholdings.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 8 — EXIT, TERMINATION & CONSEQUENCES ===\\nArticle 8 outlines the terms regarding the exit, termination, and consequences of the Agreement. It establishes that the Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until all integration activities and payments are completed, unless terminated for material breach or by Vistara or AirAsia under specified conditions. Vistara may exit the transaction, resulting in the cessation of employee transitions and forfeiture of unpaid payment tranches, while AirAsia can exit only due to a material breach by Vistara, leading to forfeiture of unpaid tranches and board representation rights. The Article also clarifies that transferred assets and routes do not revert upon termination, and payments made prior to termination are non-refundable, except in cases of fraud or willful misconduct. Confidentiality and intellectual property obligations will survive termination, and the Parties are required to cooperate with regulators for an orderly transition or unwinding of operations.\\n\\n=== ARTICLE 9 — AMENDMENTS, EVOLUTION & CHANGE ===\\nArticle 9 outlines the evolution and amendment process of the Agreement, serving as a reference for interpretation and analysis. It details the incremental introduction of amendments aimed at clarifying scope, reallocating risk, and codifying operational decisions across three drafting rounds. Each round established specific principles and obligations, impacting various articles related to employee policies, confidentiality, operational structuring, and governance. The Article emphasizes that amendments do not imply waivers of rights and mandates that future changes must be documented in writing and approved according to governance provisions. Additionally, it clarifies that this Article will remain effective even after the Agreement\\'s termination.'"
