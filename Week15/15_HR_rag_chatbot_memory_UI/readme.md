# HR Support Chatbot (RAG-Based)

## Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based **HR Support Chatbot** that answers employee questions using official company HR documents.

The chatbot is designed to:

* Provide **accurate, policy-aligned answers**
* Prevent hallucinations by grounding responses in company PDFs
* Support **context-aware follow-up questions**
* Be easily extendable to production-grade HR systems

---

## Key Features

* **PDF-based Knowledge Source**
  Uses company HR policy documents such as:

  * Welcome & company overview
  * Onboarding process
  * Code of conduct
  * Compensation & benefits
  * Leave & time-off policies
  * IT usage & security policy
  * Workplace safety guidelines

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  Answers are generated by combining:

  * Semantic search over HR documents
  * Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning

*  **Context-Aware Conversations**
  Supports follow-up questions by maintaining chat history.

* **Hallucination Control**
  If information is not present in HR documents, the chatbot explicitly says:

  > “I’m not sure based on current HR policies.”

* 💻 **Streamlit UI**
  Simple chat interface suitable for demos and internal tools.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---

## PDF Ingestion (One-Time Step)

This step converts HR PDFs into vector embeddings.

```bash
python ingest.py
```

What this does:

* Loads all PDFs from `data/`
* Splits them into semantic chunks
* Generates embeddings using OpenAI
* Stores vectors locally using FAISS

---

## Running the Chatbot

### Without Memory

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### With Context-Aware Memory (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run app_with_memory.py
```

---

## Example Questions

```
What is the onboarding process for new employees?
How many leave days am I entitled to?
Can unused leave be carried forward?
What is the IT security policy on passwords?
What should I do in case of a workplace safety incident?
```

---

## Memory Handling

* Chat history is stored in Streamlit session state
* Previous turns are included in the prompt to support follow-ups
* Retrieval is always performed using the **latest question only** to avoid noise

---

## Design Principles

* **LLM does not act as the source of truth**
  HR documents are the authority.

* **Retrieval before generation**
  Answers are grounded in retrieved policy text.

* **Fail-safe behavior**
  The chatbot refuses to answer when information is missing.

---

## Limitations

* No role-based access control 
* No document citations per answer
* Local FAISS storage (not distributed)

---


## Disclaimer

This chatbot is intended for **informational purposes only**.
Official HR decisions should always follow company policy and HR approval processes.
